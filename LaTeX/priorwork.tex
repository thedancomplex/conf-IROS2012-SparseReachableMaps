Low degree of freedom throwing machines/robots are common.  Typical throwing robots have between one and three degrees of freedom (DOF) \cite{509405, Lynch97dynamicnonprehensile, 5152525, 509335, springerlink:10.1007/s10015-006-0401-0}.  All of these mechanisms are limited to throwing in a plane.   Sentoo et al.\cite{4651142} achieved an end-effector velocity of 6.0 m/s and can throw in $R^3$ space using it's Barret Technology Inc 4-DOF arm with a $360^o$ rotation base yaw actuator.  These low degree of freedom throwing robots are either physically attached/planted to the mechanical ground or have a base that is significantly more massive then the arm.

Kim et al. \cite{JooH2011438} takes the research to the next level with finding optimal overarm and sidearm throwing motions for a high degree of freedom humanoid computer model.  The model consists of 55-DOF and is not fixed to mechanical ground or a massive base.  Motor torques are then calculated that both allows for a sidearm or overarm throw and continuously satisfies the zero-moment-point stability criteria\cite{4309277}.  

%Kim was able to receive a maximum flight time of 2.784s and 3.711s for overarm and sidearm throws respectively.
