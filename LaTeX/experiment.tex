\section{EXPERIMENT}\label{sec:exp}
A nominal goal of throwing a projectile 3.0m directly in front of the robot was chosen for testing purposes.  The estimated release point was set to the mean of the right arm's reachable area, 0.8m in $z$.  This resulted in a throwing velocity of 4.9m/s at $[\Theta, \Psi, \Phi] =[0.0^o,45.0^o, 3.8^o]$.  The projectile is a standard racquetball measuring 57mm in diameter and weighting 42.7g.

$L_d$ and the setup trajectory are created using the method shown in Section~\ref{sec:methodology} and following all specified constraints.  Fig.~\ref{fig:3dThrowPlot1} shows $L_d$ and the setup trajectory plotted within the SRM.

The trajectory was run on Jaemi Hubo with a position command period of 0.01s.  Fig~\ref{fig:3dThrowReal} shows the side profile of the Jaemi Hubo successfully running the trajectory.  The trajectory shown in Fig~\ref{fig:3dThrowReal} is considered an underhand throw, overhand and sidearm throws are also created with this method.

During the experiments the actual position of each joint was recorded.  The total time from the start of the setup phase to the end of the velocity phase is 0.31s.
