\section{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK}\label{sec:conc}
This work has shown a valid method of creating trajectories to achieve end-effector velocity control for high degree of freedom position controlled robots.  It was shown the full reachable area does not need to be known to achieve the desired velocity if a good collision model of the robot is available.  It was found that the limiting factor was the robot's physical joints.  This system does create trajectories that fall within the actuators' limitations, however this is not guaranteed.  Immediate future work includes creating a system that will guarantee actuator compliance with the generated trajectory.
